## Introduction

**Copy-to-coteditor** can help you quickly record text when you need to do so in a browser or elsewhere, eliminating the need to open a text editor to Copy and paste, it can be quickly automating text recording with ***applescript***.

## How to Use?

You can select the content which you want to record in the browser or other places, and then use the shortcut key ***fast-copy*** to get the content you want to record in **CotEditor** (the default is plain text, the recording style needs to be set separately in CotEditor).
